**HarmonyOSOverview**
- HarmonyOS Overview - 02 System Architecture
- This content focuses on the Harmony system architecture and FA/PA. The HarmonyOS adopts a hierarchical architecture design, which consists of the kernel layer, system service layer, framework layer, and application layer from bottom to top. This design makes deployment on different devices more flexible, and unnecessary parts can be deleted according to actual requirements.
This architecture makes HarmonyOS both powerful and flexible and adaptable to a wide range of usage scenarios.
